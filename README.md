# Project Name: Trivia Time

# Video Demo: PUT URL HERE

# Description

This is a fun trivia app that allows you to choose your subject category, question difficulty level, question type (T/F or multiple choice), and the number of questions desired. At the completion, it shows the time it took to take the quiz and whether you passed.

Technologies include JavaScript, React, Redux, CSS, and HTML.

The components include menus for the selections, beginning the quiz, taking the quiz again, getting new questions, and starting over.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
